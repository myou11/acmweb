                First three meetings are free and we invite you to come see what ACM is all about.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to become an official (and listed on here) member bring $15 to the Treasurer at the next meeting. If you are bringing a check make it out to CSU or CSU ACM.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also note that we are the student chapter here at CSU. Check below and/or click on the ACM logo to see the official site for more info for ACM (not the student chapter with a completely separate membership fee).

            <h1>Who are we?</h1>
            <p>
                The Colorado State University ACM Student Chapter is a club dedicated to the pursuit of computing knowledge. We coordinate and schedule informational, demonstrational, and recruiting talks from business leaders, university professors, and industry experts. Our purpose is to facilitate learning of the computing industry while establishing networking opportunities for our students.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also organize events such as hackathons, coding competitions, tutorials, demonstrations/presentations, and relaxing events such as a game or a movie night. We also run a side project initiative to help students work together outside of class to help build their skills, resume, and have some fun that you do not get in any of the CS courses.

            <h1>What is ACM?</h1>
            <p>
                The Association for Computing Machinery is an international, scientific, and educational organization that delivers resources for advanced computing as a science and a profession. ACM was originally founded in 1947 at Columbia University in New York when the study of computer science was in its infancy. Since its foundation the organization has been growing in membership, eventually organizing into student chapters. This was done as an effort to expand the organization and the potential members in it, with a focus on young computer science students. This has allowed colleges across the world to apply, create a chapter, and participate in ACM and its shared resources. This is where Colorado State University came into the picture. In 1977, CSU founded a chapter that allowed students to join and become a member of ACM. Since then the ACM Student Chapter at CSU is still thriving with a solid membership base of dedicated students driven towards computing excellence.

            <h1>What are the benefits of being a member?</h1>
            <p>
                You get to list being an ACM member on your resume! This is a huge benefit as employers in the computing industry know what ACM is and will look highly upon your membership! Also, many speakers are looking for interns or new hires and we are able to help facilitate getting our members these positions. ACM club is also a great place to meet other tech-interested people and relax on (usually) Wednesday nights.

            <h1>What about ACM-W?</h1>
            <p>
                ACM-W is a similar club under the ACM umbrella that looks to <em>"support, celebrate, and advocate internationally for the full engagement of women in all aspects of the computing field".</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                ACM and ACM-W here at CSU will hold joint meetings occasionally and encourage all students to attend both clubs. Check out their <a href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~acm-w/">site</a>.
